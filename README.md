# IT Project: "Nico's PC Shop"
---
For this year's 10th IT project, our goal was to create a website without any topic limitations. I chose to build a simple PC shop website, which I thought would be a fun project.

- Images of numbers: [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/) - They are using the numbers as emojis.

The website might seem a little bit scattered, and this is due to the limitations we were given. Additionally, I had to try not to overcomplicate the site, and the motivation to correct some of the mistakes just wasn't there. 
I really don't enjoy styling websites with CSS.
